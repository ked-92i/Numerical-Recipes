A collection of octave functions that solve common problems in applied Mathematics.


I would like to make an anecdotal mention of the fact that I serendipitously picked up a number of numerical recipes/ numerical methods for numerical analysis books laying around at the Wright State Russ Engineering Center a couple of years ago. I relish in the fact that somebody's clutter became the holy grail of the answers to "Why would anyone become a computer engineer?". I remember googling the optimal value for h in the forward approximation of the derivative being an important "aha" moment in my career as a programmer. While my main interest lies more in pure math than anything else, no one is an island. And to those who might be as inclined to the history of science as I am, I am a great fan of Gerolamo Cardan and Georg Cantor! My name is Koco and I (mostly) code in Octave!!





Best to all.
